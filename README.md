<h2>🌠Overview</h2>
In the game, two players take turns rolling two dice. The goal is to accumulate points while avoiding rolling a 1. Players can choose to “Hold” their current score to add it to their global score.

<h2>🎮Game Rules </h2>

1. There are 2 players, each with their own panel.
2. Players use the same play button(Roll Dice), each at a time.
3. Everytime a player rolls the dice, different random numbers are generated and the round score added to Current Score
4. Incase the two dice generate 1s simultaneously upon rolling the dice, the active player loses his Current score and it's now the next player's turn.
5. A player can choose to Hold; which means saving the current score to the Global Score
